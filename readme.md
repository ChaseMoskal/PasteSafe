PasteSafe needs your help!

I originally built PasteSafe as a means for me to personally learn about cryptography in general, which in fact makes me the opposite of a cryptography expert. I was hoping that somebody knowledgable and generally cool – *exactly like you* – would be able to help by pointing out flaws in PasteSafe (the [core AES encryption implementation](https://github.com/PasteSafe/pcrypto/blob/master/source/pcrypto.ts) or otherwise) by writing new issues and comments on the relevant Github project.

There are two PasteSafe github projects:
- [PasteSafe Web App](https://github.com/PasteSafe/pastesafe.github.io) <-- You are here
- [pcrypto npm module](https://github.com/PasteSafe/pcrypto) (web crypto is here)

PasteSafe is still very much a work-in-progress. I want to create a free and open security tool that users can trust. My main focus now is to continue improving and refactoring the existing code, and begin exposing the project publicly with hopes to solicit peer-review.

Your review of PasteSafe and pcrypto code would be very much appreciated – please raise an issue about anything you see.

Issues, comments, and pull requests are gladly welcomed by both projects.
