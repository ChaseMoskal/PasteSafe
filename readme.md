*instant web cryptography*

- this tool makes it easy to share private information via email
- built on the [Web Cryptography API](https://www.w3.org/TR/WebCryptoAPI/)
- written in [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- development experience preconfigured for [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

there are two pastesafe github projects:
- [pastesafe web app](https://github.com/pastesafe/pastesafe.github.io) <-- You are here
- [pcrypto npm module](https://github.com/pastesafe/pcrypto) (web crypto is here)

pastesafe is still very much a work-in-progress
